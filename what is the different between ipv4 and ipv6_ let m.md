# what is the different between ipv4 and ipv6? let me know examples, please  i need to understand clearly and easily

The main difference between **IPv4** and **IPv6** is the format and size of their addresses, which impacts how many devices can be uniquely identified on the internet.

**Key Differences:**


| Feature | IPv4 | IPv6 |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Address Length** | 32 bits (4 numbers) | 128 bits (8 groups) |
| **Address Format** | Numeric, decimal, separated by dots (.) | Alphanumeric, hexadecimal, separated by colons (:) |
| **Example** | `192.168.1.1` | `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334` |
| **Total Addresses** | About 4.3 billion | About 340 undecillion (a number with 38 digits) |
| **Security** | Not built-in; relies on applications | Built-in (IPsec for encryption and authentication) |
| **Configuration** | Manual or DHCP | Automatic, manual, DHCP, or renumbering |
| **Transmission** | Unicast, broadcast, multicast | Unicast, multicast, anycast (no broadcast) |
| **Header Size** | 20–60 bytes | Fixed at 40 bytes |
| **Address Classes** | Five (A–E) | No classes |
| **End-to-End Integrity** | Not achievable | Achievable |
| **NAT (Network Address Translation)** | Commonly used to conserve addresses | Not needed due to vast address space |

**Examples:**

- **IPv4 Address:**
`192.168.10.150`
This is a typical home or office network address, using four numbers between 0 and 255, separated by dots[^1][^2].
- **IPv6 Address:**
`2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`
This uses eight groups of four hexadecimal digits, separated by colons[^1][^2].

**Why IPv6?**

- IPv4’s 4.3 billion addresses are not enough for all the world’s devices, so technologies like NAT were used to share addresses, but this complicates networking.
- IPv6 solves this with a massive address space, allowing every device to have its own unique address, making the internet more scalable and secure[^1][^3][^2].

**Other Differences:**

- **Security:** IPv6 has built-in security features (IPsec), while IPv4 relies on external solutions[^4][^5][^2].
- **Configuration:** IPv6 can configure itself automatically, while IPv4 often needs manual setup or DHCP[^2][^6].
- **Transmission:** IPv4 uses broadcasts (sending data to all devices), while IPv6 uses multicasts and anycasts, which are more efficient[^4][^2][^6].

**In summary:**
IPv4 is older, simpler, and uses shorter numeric addresses. IPv6 is newer, uses much longer alphanumeric addresses, has vastly more address space, built-in security, and is designed to support the modern, ever-growing internet[^4][^1][^3][^2][^6].
